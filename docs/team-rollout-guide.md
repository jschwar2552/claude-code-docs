**Last updated**: Aug 29, 2025  
**PMM**: Alex Isken **PM**: Cat Wu **AAI**: Jeremy Hadfield **Sales**: Rachel Pang

## Executive Summary

### What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is an agentic command line tool that lets developers delegate complex, multi-step coding tasks directly from their terminal. Unlike autocomplete tools, Claude Code can handle entire projects - understanding codebases, making multi-file changes, running tests, and managing workflows with code changes.

### Key Value Props (30-second version)

- **Agentic coding agent** - Handles complex, multi-step tasks autonomously
- **Deep codebase understanding** - Searches and understands entire codebases without manual file selection
- **Vertically integrated** - We design both the model and the agent scaffold for optimal performance
- **Works with existing tools** - Uses your CLI tools (git, Sentry, AWS, etc.)
- **Secure by design** - Direct API calls, no code indexing, shows work before execution
- **Integrates with your favorite dev tools** - Runs in the terminal and can be used within or alongside any IDE
- **Flexible and customizable** - Use in the terminal as a collaborator, or use via GitHub Actions for async work. Or, build custom workflows with the Claude Code SDK

### Target Buyer Profile

**Primary**: Head of/VP of Developer Productivity, Engineering Manager, CTO  
**Secondary**: Senior Engineers, Platform Teams, AI/ML Teams

**Pain Points They Have**:
- Pressure to offer AI tools to developers
- Need to reduce development bottlenecks
- Want to accelerate feature delivery
- Struggling with developer onboarding to new codebases

### The Anthropic Advantage

Use this positioning when explaining why Claude Code is different:

*"At Anthropic, we have a unique advantage because we train our own models AND design our agent scaffold - the tools, prompts, and how Claude operates in the CLI. This vertical integration allows us to co-design the agent with our models, ensuring the scaffold amplifies our model's strengths."*

*"Fairly subtle differences in scaffolding can result in substantial performance differences. With hundreds of Anthropic researchers and engineers using Claude Code daily, we have a tight feedback loop for refining the scaffold to squeeze maximum performance from our models."*

*"For your developers, this translates into an agent that can actually solve problems other tools can't - it's more efficient, writes higher quality code, fits your team's style better, and makes fewer mistakes. This means Claude Code becomes a software engineering agent you can delegate real work to, without requiring constant oversight."*

## Competitive Differentiation

### vs. GitHub Copilot

**When they say**: "We already have Copilot"  
**Your response**: "Copilot is excellent for autocomplete and code suggestions, but Claude Code handles different use cases entirely. Think of Copilot as helping you write individual lines of code faster, while Claude Code can take on entire projects - like migrating a service from one framework to another, or building a complete feature across multiple files. Many of our customers use both tools because they solve different problems."

**Key differentiation**:
- Copilot: Line-level autocomplete
- Claude Code: Project-level task execution

### vs. Cursor

**When they say**: "We're already using Cursor"  
**Your response**: "Cursor is a great IDE with AI features, but Claude Code is designed for a different workflow entirely. Cursor works within your IDE for editing and chat, while Claude Code is a command line agent that can autonomously handle complex, multi-step tasks. It's the difference between having an AI assistant help you edit code versus having an AI teammate you can delegate entire features to."

**Key differentiation**:
- Cursor: IDE-based editing and chat
- Claude Code: Autonomous task delegation from command line, can integrate with any IDE for developers who prefer JetBrains or other platforms

### vs. Other AI Coding Tools

**When they say**: "What about [other CLI tool]?"  
**Your response**: "The biggest difference between other CLI tools and Claude Code is that we're combining the best coding models in the world with our own harness custom built for those models. We built the Claude Code scaffolding, including how it uses tools and prompts, to accentuate the strengths of the Claude models. Claude Code also offers much more customization and flexibility than these other tools, including IDE integrations, multiple SDKs, and the ability to integrate with GitHub."

**Key differentiation**:
- **Codex CLI**: CLI interface + Gemini 2.5 Pro
- **Gemini CLI**: CLI interface + various OpenAI models
- **Claude Code**: CLI interface built for Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4, with functionality that extends beyond the terminal: IDE integrations, SDKs, and GitHub integration.

|-------|--------|---------|
| Tell me about your current AI tooling for developers. | What tools are you using? (Copilot, Cursor, etc.) How's adoption going? Any gaps or pain points? | What are your biggest developer productivity challenges? Bottlenecks in development cycle? Onboarding new developers? Working across unfamiliar codebases? |
| Has anyone on your team started trying Claude Code already? | How do you typically evaluate and roll out new developer tools? How are these kinds of decisions typically made? Who else will be providing input? | When would you like to start seeing value from this initiative? What's your pilot process? How do you measure success? Any security or compliance requirements for tools that access code? |
| What would a successful pilot look like? | What specific outcomes would be considered a success? When those outcomes are realized, how will it impact 2025+ revenues? | What are some outcomes you want to avoid? |

#### Positioning (5 minutes)
Based on their answers, choose your positioning:

- **If they have existing AI tools**: "It sounds like you're already seeing value from AI in development. Claude Code complements those tools by handling a different use case entirely - instead of helping write individual lines of code, it can take on entire projects autonomously..."

- **If they're just starting with AI**: "You're in a great position to implement a comprehensive AI strategy. Claude Code is often our customers' first API use case because it delivers immediate, measurable value to developers..."

#### Use Cases (10 minutes)
Choose 2-3 most relevant based on their situation:

- **For enterprise development velocity (like Rakuten)**: "Rakuten, with thousands of developers, reduced their time to market from 24 days to 5 days. They achieved 7 hours of sustained autonomous coding on complex refactoring projects with 99.9% accuracy."

- **For financial services/high-quality standards (like Ramp)**: "Ramp processes over 1 million lines of AI-suggested code monthly while maintaining their reputation for shipping features every other day."

#### Next Steps (2 minutes)
"Based on what you've shared, I think a pilot would be valuable. We typically start with 20-50 developers for about a month. I can work with you to identify the right teams and set up success metrics. What would be the best way to move forward?"

## Pilot Process

## Objection Handling

### "We already have GitHub Copilot/Cursor/[other tool]"

**Response**: "That's great - most of our customers use Claude Code alongside their existing tools because they solve different problems. Copilot excels at autocomplete, while Claude Code handles autonomous, multi-step tasks. Think of it as the difference between having spell-check versus having a research assistant write your report."

**Follow-up**: "Many customers find that Claude Code actually makes their existing tools more valuable by handling the complex setup work, leaving developers free to use Copilot for the detailed implementation."

### "How much does this cost?"

**Response**: "Claude Code uses consumption-based pricing - you only pay for what you use, typically $25 per developer per day for active usage. Most customers find this delivers 10x ROI when you factor in the time savings and increased output."

**Follow-up**: "The best way to understand the cost-benefit is through a pilot. We can provide credits upfront so you can test it with real workloads and measure the actual impact."

### "We're concerned about security/IP protection"

**Response**: "Security is fundamental to Claude Code's design. Your code goes directly to our models via API - there are no intermediary servers, no code indexing, and no data retention. Claude Code shows you exactly what it's going to do before making any changes."

**Follow-up**: "We work with financial services and healthcare customers who have strict compliance requirements. I can share our security documentation and connect you with our security team if needed."

### "Our developers won't use command line tools"

**Response**: "That's a common concern, but we've found that even developers who prefer IDEs quickly adopt Claude Code because it handles tasks their IDE tools can't. Plus, we have VS Code and JetBrains integrations that bring Claude Code capabilities into familiar environments."

**Follow-up**: "The key is starting with developers who are already comfortable with CLI tools - they become internal advocates and help spread adoption."

### "We need to see ROI before investing"

**Response**: "Absolutely - that's exactly why we recommend starting with a pilot. Rakuten saw 79% reduction in time-to-market, going from 24 days to 5 days, with 99.9% accuracy on complex code modifications. Ramp processes over 1 million lines of AI-suggested code monthly while maintaining their daily shipping cadence."

**Follow-up**: "We'll help you set up metrics tracking so you can measure concrete impact on developer velocity, code quality, and time-to-market before making a larger commitment. Our customers typically see measurable results within the first 2-4 weeks of their pilot."

### "This seems like it could replace developers"

**Response**: "Claude Code is designed to augment developers, not replace them. It handles the repetitive, time-consuming tasks so your developers can focus on architecture, problem-solving, and innovation. Our customers report higher developer satisfaction because they're spending time on more interesting, high-value work."
