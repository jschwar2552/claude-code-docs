# Claude Code Engineering Best Practices

Comprehensive guide to using Claude Code effectively in software development workflows, based on engineering insights and real-world usage patterns.

## Core Principles

### Be Specific in Instructions
- Provide clear, detailed requirements for complex tasks
- Include context about existing code patterns and conventions
- Specify expected outcomes and success criteria
- Use examples when possible to illustrate desired behavior

### Iterate and Refine
- Start with broad requirements, then refine based on initial results
- Use feedback loops to improve code quality and alignment
- Don't expect perfection on the first attempt - embrace iteration
- Continuously adjust approach based on what works for your codebase

### Provide Clear Context
- Maintain comprehensive CLAUDE.md files for project-specific guidance
- Share relevant documentation and architectural decisions
- Explain business logic and domain-specific requirements
- Keep Claude informed about team conventions and preferences

### Experiment with Different Approaches
- Try multiple workflow strategies to find what works best
- Adapt techniques based on project type and complexity
- Learn from both successes and failures
- Share insights with your team to improve collective practices

## Essential Setup and Customization

### 1. Create Comprehensive CLAUDE.md Files

**Project Root CLAUDE.md**:
```markdown
# Project Guidelines

## Development Environment
- Node.js 18+, Python 3.9+
- Use npm for package management
- Run tests with `npm test` before commits

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new JavaScript code
- Follow ESLint configuration in .eslintrc.js
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Use descriptive variable names

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests required for all business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Use Jest for JavaScript testing
- Aim for >80% test coverage

## Repository Structure
- `/src` - Source code
- `/tests` - Test files
- `/docs` - Project documentation
- `/scripts` - Build and deployment scripts
```

**Feature-Specific CLAUDE.md**:
```markdown
# Authentication Module

## Architecture
- JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration
- Refresh tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies
- User roles: admin, user, readonly

## Security Requirements
- All passwords must use bcrypt hashing
- Input validation on all auth endpoints
- Rate limiting on login attempts

## Team Preferences
- Prefer async/await over promises
- Use custom AuthError classes for error handling
- Log all authentication events for audit
```

### 2. Optimize Bash Tools and Environment

**Essential Command Aliases**:
```bash
# Add to your .bashrc or .zshrc
alias cc-test="npm test && npm run lint"
alias cc-commit="git add . && git commit -m"
alias cc-deploy="npm run build && npm run deploy"
```

**Environment Variables**:
```bash
# Claude Code specific settings
export CLAUDE_CODE_EDITOR="code"  # Default editor for file reviews
export CLAUDE_CODE_BROWSER="chrome"  # Browser for documentation
export CLAUDE_CODE_MODEL="sonnet"  # Preferred model for cost optimization
```

### 3. MCP Server Integration

**Recommended MCP Servers**:
- **Database MCP**: Direct database queries and schema inspection
- **GitHub MCP**: Advanced Git operations and repository management
- **Documentation MCP**: Integration with Confluence, Notion, or internal wikis
- **Testing MCP**: Advanced testing frameworks and coverage reporting

**MCP Configuration Example**:
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "database": {
        "command": "mcp-database",
        "args": ["--connection-string", "$DB_URL"]
      },
      "github": {
        "command": "mcp-github", 
        "args": ["--token", "$GITHUB_TOKEN"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Proven Workflow Strategies

### 1. "Explore, Plan, Code, Commit" Workflow

**Step 1: Explore** (5-10 minutes)
```bash
# Let Claude understand the codebase
claude "Please explore this repository and understand the architecture. 
Pay special attention to the authentication system and how user data flows 
through the application."
```

**Step 2: Plan** (10-15 minutes)
```bash
# Get architectural recommendations
claude "I need to add user profile editing functionality. 
Can you propose 3 different architectural approaches and 
recommend the best one based on our existing patterns?"
```

**Step 3: Code** (30-120 minutes)
```bash
# Implement the feature
claude "Please implement the user profile editing feature using 
the approach we discussed. Include comprehensive tests and 
follow our existing error handling patterns."
```

**Step 4: Commit** (5 minutes)
```bash
# Review and commit changes
claude "Please review the changes we made, run tests, 
and create a proper git commit with a descriptive message."
```

### 2. Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Claude Code

**Red Phase**:
```bash
claude "Write failing tests for user profile editing functionality. 
Include edge cases for invalid data, unauthorized access, 
and database errors."
```

**Green Phase**:
```bash
claude "Now implement the minimal code needed to make these tests pass. 
Focus on functionality first, optimization later."
```

**Refactor Phase**:
```bash
claude "Refactor the implementation to improve code quality while 
keeping all tests passing. Look for opportunities to reduce 
duplication and improve readability."
```

### 3. Visual Iteration with Screenshots

**For UI Development**:
1. Take screenshots of current state
2. Provide to Claude with desired changes
3. Let Claude generate updated code
4. Review visually and iterate

**Example Workflow**:
```bash
# After taking a screenshot of your current UI
claude "Here's the current login form (screenshot attached). 
I need to add a 'Remember Me' checkbox and improve the visual 
hierarchy. Please update the React component and CSS."
```

### 4. Safe YOLO Mode

**When to Use**:
- Refactoring well-tested code
- Making cosmetic changes
- Working on throwaway prototypes
- Applying known patterns to new areas

**Setup**:
```bash
# Enable more autonomous behavior
claude --mode=autonomous "Refactor the user authentication system 
to use TypeScript interfaces instead of PropTypes. Update all 
related files and ensure tests pass."
```

## Advanced Interaction Techniques

### 1. "Think" Modes for Complex Problems

**Sequential Thinking**:
```bash
claude "Before implementing the payment processing system, 
please think through the security implications, error handling 
strategies, and testing approaches. Walk me through your reasoning."
```

**Architectural Analysis**:
```bash
claude "Analyze our current database schema and think about 
how to optimize it for the new user activity tracking feature. 
Consider performance, scalability, and data privacy."
```

### 2. Context Management Strategies

**Use /clear Strategically**:
- Clear context when switching between major features
- Maintain context within related tasks
- Start fresh for debugging sessions

**Multiple Claude Instances**:
- Use different instances for different features
- Employ parallel development workflows
- Cross-verify complex implementations

**Subagent Workflows**:
```bash
# Delegate specific tasks to subagents
claude "Create a subagent focused on testing that can review 
all the code we write today and suggest additional test cases."
```

### 3. Custom Slash Commands

**Create Reusable Commands**:

**/deploy** command:
```markdown
# Deployment Checklist
1. Run full test suite
2. Check for console errors  
3. Verify environment variables
4. Build production bundle
5. Deploy to staging
6. Run smoke tests
7. Deploy to production
```

**/security-review** command:
```markdown
# Security Review Process
1. Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities
2. Verify input validation on all endpoints
3. Ensure proper authentication checks
4. Review error messages for information leakage
5. Check for XSS vulnerabilities
6. Verify HTTPS usage
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Headless Mode for Automation

**CI/CD Integration**:
```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
name: AI Code Review
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  ai-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Claude Code Review
        run: |
          claude --headless "Review this pull request for security 
          issues, performance problems, and adherence to our coding 
          standards. Provide specific recommendations."
```

**Automated Testing**:
```bash
# Scheduled test generation
claude --headless "Generate additional edge case tests for any 
code that was modified in the last 24 hours. Focus on error 
conditions and boundary cases."
```

### 2. Git Worktrees for Parallel Development

**Setup Multiple Workspaces**:
```bash
# Create parallel workspaces for different features
git worktree add ../project-feature-auth -b feature/auth-improvements
git worktree add ../project-feature-ui -b feature/ui-updates

# Use Claude in each workspace for focused development
cd ../project-feature-auth && claude "Focus on authentication improvements"
cd ../project-feature-ui && claude "Focus on UI updates"
```

### 3. Multi-Claude Workflows

**Verification Pattern**:
```bash
# Claude 1: Implement the feature
claude "Implement user profile editing with comprehensive error handling"

# Claude 2: Review and critique
claude "Review the user profile editing implementation. 
Look for security issues, performance problems, and missing edge cases."

# Claude 3: Create additional tests
claude "Based on this implementation and the review feedback, 
create comprehensive test cases that weren't already covered."
```

**Specialized Roles**:
- **Implementation Claude**: Focus on writing code
- **Review Claude**: Focus on code quality and security
- **Testing Claude**: Focus on comprehensive test coverage
- **Documentation Claude**: Focus on updating documentation

## Quality Assurance Patterns

### 1. Pre-Commit Workflows

**Automated Quality Checks**:
```bash
# Create a pre-commit hook
claude "Create a pre-commit script that:
1. Runs ESLint and fixes auto-fixable issues
2. Runs tests and prevents commit if they fail
3. Checks for TODO comments and warns about them
4. Validates commit message format"
```

### 2. Code Review Integration

**AI-Assisted Reviews**:
```bash
# Before requesting human review
claude "Review this pull request as if you were a senior developer. 
Look for:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues  
- Code maintainability
- Test coverage gaps
- Documentation needs"
```

### 3. Continuous Improvement

**Retrospective Analysis**:
```bash
# Weekly improvement sessions
claude "Analyze the code we've written this week. 
What patterns emerge? What could we improve in our development process?
Are there opportunities for better automation or testing?"
```
